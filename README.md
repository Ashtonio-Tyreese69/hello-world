"Hello World!!

 The name's Ashton, and I've just started
my github account! I don't havw a clue
about programming....... yet. I'm hoping
I can change that pretty soon, though!!
 
 I just started to learn code today with
the Grasshoper app, and I'm REALLY looking
forward to get into app making and ethical 
hacking in the not-so-distant future.

 So,prepare to be seeing more of me very 
soon. Keep it real and up hill, everyone.
I hope to gain a few friends while I'm here.
